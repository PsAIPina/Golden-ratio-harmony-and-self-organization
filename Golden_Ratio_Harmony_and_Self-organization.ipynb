    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">By studying sources of mathematics origins, we inevitably come to Pythagoras and his doctrine, called Pythagoreanism [1]. According to the tradition, Pythagoreans were divided into two separate schools of thought, the mathēmatikoi (mathematicians) and the akousmatikoi (listeners). Listeners developed religious and ritual aspects of Pythagoreanism, mathematicians studied four Pythagorean MATHEM’s: arithmetic, geometry, harmonics and spherics. These MATHEM’s, according to Pythagoras, were the main component parts of mathematics. Unfortunately, the Pythagorean MATHEM of harmonics was lost in mathematics in the process of historical development.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Johannes Kepler, brilliant astronomer and author of \"Kepler's laws,” expressed his admiration for the golden ratio in the following words:\n",
    "\"Geometry has two great treasures: one is the theorem of Pythagoras; the other the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first we may compare to a measure of gold; the second we may name a precious jewel.\" (taken from [2]). You should recall that the ancient problem of the division of a line segment in extreme and mean ratio was Euclid’s language for the golden ratio! Thus, the idea of Harmony, which underlies the ancient Greek doctrine of Nature, was the main “paradigm” of Greek science starting from Pythagoras and ending by Euclid. This relates directly to the golden ratio and Platonic solids, which are the most important Greek mathematical discoveries, which had expressed Universe Harmony.[3]\n",
    " \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Dirac states: “If this theory is really beautiful, then it necessarily will appear as a fine model of important physical phenomena. It is necessary to search for these phenomena to develop applications of the beautiful mathematical theory and to interpret them as predictions of new laws of physics.” Thus, according to Dirac, all new physics, including relativistic and quantum, develop in this way.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In 1962, American physicist and historian of science Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996) published the book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". In his book, Kuhn had substantiated a concept of changing \"scientific paradigms\" as premise of the “scientific revolutions.” What was the major idea (paradigm) of the ancient Greek science? A majority of researchers give the following answer: the idea of Harmony associated with the \"golden ratio\" and “Platonic Solids\". The prominent Russian philosopher Alexey Losiv argues: “From Plato’s point of view, and in general in terms of the entire ancient cosmology, the Universe is determined as a certain proportional whole that obeys the law of harmonic division - the golden section. *The ancient Greek system of cosmic proportions in the literature is then interpreted as a curious result of unrestrained and wild imagination. In such explanations we can see the unscientific helplessness of those who claim it. However, we can understand this historical and aesthetic phenomenon only in connection with a holistic understanding of history, that is, by using a dialectical view of culture and looking for the answer in the peculiarities of ancient social life.\"*[3] \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Alexey Stakhov’s book “The Mathematics of Harmony. From Euclid to Contemporary Mathematics and Computer Science” (World Scientific, 2009) [2] and Stakhov & Aranson’s book “Golden” Non- Euclidean Geometry. Hilbert’s Fourth Problem, “Golden” Dynamical System, and Fine-Structure Constant” (World Scientific, 2016) [4] can be seen as the first attempts to revive in modern science and mathematics, the Pythagorean MATEM of \"harmonics\" and also the \"harmonic ideas” of Pythagoras, Plato and Euclid. It is shown in the books [2,6,7,23,26,27,33,34,51,57,58] and the articles [8 - 22,25,28- 32, 35-50,52-56] that the \"harmonic ideas” of Pythagoras, Plato and Euclid affect not only the foundations of modern theoretical physics (in particular, Einstein’s special theory of relativity) and the foundations of mathematics (in particular, number theory and geometry), but they can also be source of the numeral systems with irrational bases, which are the basis of new computer projects (Fibonacci computers). Modern Mathematics of Harmony contains a large number of excellent mathematical results, which can decorate many of the traditional mathematical disciplines. We are talking about new look on the history of mathematics (Proclus’ hypothesis), about new classes of recurrent relations and new mathematical constants, following from Pascal’s triangle, about new types of recursive hyperbolic functions, about the original solution of Hilbert’s Fourth Problem, which underlies the \"Golden\" non- Euclidean geometry, about new numeral systems with irrational bases for computer science. In addition, the Mathematics of Harmony develops new original view on special theory of relativity, which leads us to a new view on the fundamental physical constants such as the Fine-Structure Constant.[3]\n"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">The question arises, what purpose pursued Euclid by placing Platonic solids in the final book of his Elements.[3] Proclus’ hypothesis, formulated in the 5th century by the Greek philosopher and mathematician Proclus Diadochus (412 – 485), contains a surprising answer to this question [29]. According to Proclus, Euclid’s main goal at writing his Elements was not simply to set forth geometry itself what is traditional view on Euclid’s Elements, but to build a complete theory of the regular polyhedra (“Platonic solids”) what was an essential element (paradigm) of Plato's cosmology. This theory was outlined by Euclid in the concluding or thirteenth book of the Elements. This fact in itself is an indirect confirmation of Proclus’ hypothesis. Often the most important scientific information is found in the concluding part of scientific publication. Proclus' hypothesis is the most unexpected hypothesis in the history of mathematics, which alters our traditional ideas about the history of mathematics. It follows from this hypothesis that Euclid’s Elements are the source of the two directions in the history of mathematics - Classical Mathematics and Mathematics of Harmony.[3]\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">For many centuries, the creation of Classic Mathematics, Queen of the Natural Sciences, was the main goal of mathematicians. However, by studying the works of Pythagoras, Plato, Euclid, Fibonacci, Pacioli, and Kepler, we can conclude that the intellectual forces of many prominent mathematicians and thinkers were directed towards the development of the basic concepts and applications of the Mathematics of Harmony what, according to Proclus, was the main “paradigm” of Euclid’s Elements. Unfortunately, these two important mathematical approaches (Classic Mathematics and the Mathematics of Harmony) evolved separately from one another.  e time has come to unite these two mathematical approaches.  This important unification can now lead to novel scientific discoveries in both mathematics and the theoretical natural sciences.[3]\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">The dodecahedron (Fig. 1d) and its dual the icosahedron (Fig. 1e) play a special role among the Platonic solids. The geometry of both relate directly to the golden ratio. Indeed, all faces of the dodecahedron are regular pentagons, based on the golden ratio. If we look closely at the icosahedron in Fig. 1e, we can see that in each of its vertices the five triangles come together and their outer edges form a regular pentagon. These facts reveal the crucial role the golden ratio in the geometric construction of these two Platonic solids.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">However, there are other deep mathematical confirmations of the fundamental role of the golden ratio in the icosahedron and dodecahedron.[3] The Platonic solids have three specific spheres. The first (inner) sphere is inscribed inside the Platonic solid and touches the centers of its faces. Let denote the radius of the inner sphere as $R_i$. The second or middle sphere of the Platonic solid touches its ribs. We denote the radius of the middle sphere as $R_m$. Finally, the third (outer) sphere is circumscribed around the Platonic solid and passes through its vertices. We denote its radius as $R_c$ . In geometry, it is demonstrated that the values of the radii of these spheres for the dodecahedron and the icosahedron with an edge of unit length is expressed through the golden ratio (Table 1).\n",

    "### 3.1 The Generalized Principle of the Golden Section in modern philosophy\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Recently the Byelorussian philosopher Eduardo Soroko developed very original approach to structural harmony of systems [60]. He was one of the first researchers who used the generalized principle of the golden section for simulation of the processes in self-organizing systems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Soroko's main idea was to study real systems from the dialectical point of view. As is well known, any natural object can be represented as the dialectical unity of the two opposite sides A and B.[59] This dialectical connection may be expressed in the following form:\n",
    "$$ A+B=U (Universum) \\tag{32}$$\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The equality (32) is the most general expression of the so-called conservation law. Here A and B are distinctions inside of the Unity, logically disjoint classes of the whole. There is the one requirement that A and B need to be measured by the same measure. Probability and inprobability of events, mass and energy, the nucleus of an atom and its envelope, substance and field, anode and cathode, animals and plants, spiritual and material beginnings in a value system, and profit and cost are various examples of (32).\n",
    "The identity (32) may be reduced to the following normalized form:\n",
    "$$ \\overline{A}+\\overline{B}=1, \\tag{33}$$ \n",
    "where $\\overline{A}$ and $\\overline{B}$ are the relative \"weights\" of the parts A and B that make up some Unity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Let us consider the process of system self-organization. This one is reduced to the passage of the system into some \"harmonic\" state called the state of “harmonic” equilibrium. There is some correlation or proportion between the sides A and B of the dialectical contradiction (30) for the state of thermodynamic equilibrium. This correlation has a strictly regular character and is the cause of system stability. Soroko uses the principle of multiple relations to find a connecting law between A and B in the state of “harmonic” equilibrium. This principle is well known in chemistry as Dalton's Law and in crystallography as the law of rational parameters.\n",
    "By studying the equality (33), Soroko came to conclusion that the generalized principle of the golden section (27) can be used for the solution to this important problem and has finished his very interesting reasoning’s by the following assertion called \"Law of structural harmony of systems\":\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> <i>The generalized golden proportions are invariants that allow for natural systems in the process of their self-organization to find harmonious structure, a stationary regime for their existence, and structural and functional stability.</i>\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">According to Soroko`s opinion [60] this general law has the widest applications in Nature, Science and Art for modeling processes in self-organizing systems (substance structure, technology of structural-complicated products, ontogenetic structures of organism, human intellect and its creations). \n",
    "What is a principal peculiarity of Sorokos Law for modern science of system harmony? Starting from Pythagoras the harmony researchers connected a harmony concept with the classical Golden Proportion $\\tau=\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}=1.618$ is considered as the only and unique proportion of 2 harmonious systems. \n",

    "relations (13) and (14). The abridged notation of the sum (34) has the following form:\n",
    "$$N = a_na_{n-1}...a_i...a_1 \\tag{35}$$ \n",
    "Note that the notion of the Fibonacci $p$-code (34) includes an infinite number of different positional “binary” representations of natural numbers because every p produces its own Fibonacci $p$-code ($p=0,1,2,3,...$). In particular, for the case $p=0$ the Fibonacci p-code (34) is reduced to the classical binary code:\n",
    "$$ N=a_n2^{n-1}+a_{n-1}2^{n-2}+...+a_i^{2i-1}+...+a_12^0 \\tag{36}$$ For the case $p=1$ the Fibonacci $p$-code (34) is reduced to the following sum:\n",
    "$$ N=a_nF_n +a_{n-1}F_{n-1} +...+a_iF_i +...+a_1F_1 \\tag{37}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Fibonacci’s representation (37) in the “Fibonacci numbers theory” [61] is called Zekendorf’s sum after Belgian researcher Eduardo Zekendorf (1901-1983). For the case $p = \\inf$ all *Fibonacci* $p$-numbers in (34) are equal to 1 identically and then the Fibonacci $p$-code (34) is reduced to the sum:\n",

    "which is known in number theory as Euclidean definition of natural number.\n",

    "Thus, the Fibonacci $p$-code (34) is a wide generalization of the classical binary code (36), Zekendorf’s sum (37) and Euclidean definition of natural numbers (38).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The introduced above new positional representations – Fibonacci $p$-code (34), Bergman system (24) and codes of the golden $p$-proportions can be the sources of new computer projects – Fibonacci computers. This concept, first described in Stakhov’s book [62], is one of the important ideas of modern computer science. The essence of the concept consists of the following. Modern computers are based on the binary system (21), which represents all numbers as the sums of the binary numbers with binary coefficients, 0 and 1. However, the binary system (21) is non-redundant what does not allow detecting errors, which could appear in computer in the process of its exploitation. In order to eliminate this shortcoming, Alexey Stakhov suggested in [62] to use the Fibonacci $p$-codes and codes of the golden $p$-proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">It is important to note the recent applications of the Fibonacci codes (34) to digital signal processing. In the Russian science the idea of the use of Fibonacci $p$-numbers for the design of superfast algorithms for digital signal processing were actively developed by the Professor Vladimir Chernov, Doctor in Physics and Mathematics at Samara the Images Processing Institute of the Russian Academy of Science [62]. Also Fibonacci $p$-numbers for the development of superfast algorithms for digital signal processing are widely used by the research group from the Tampere International Center for Signal Processing (Finland). As is shown in the book [58], the superfast algorithms for digital signal processing requires a processing of numerical data represented in the Fibonacci p-codes (34). This means that for the realization of such superfast transformations require the specialized Fibonacci signal processors! This is why the problem of Fibonacci processor development is of vital concern today!\n",

The golden ratio has been recently suggested for an expansion to the field of probabilistic and artificial intelligence in Tanackov et al. [64], in brain research [65, 66], and in human facial proportion [67,68]. Considering the number of hydrogen bonds of genetic code matrix and establishing a relation with golden ratio matrix, Hu et al. has constructed three-dimensional cubes from two-dimensional matrices. Furthermore, they revealed some numerical patterns of golden ratios under basic addition operation. The relationship data about the genetic stochastic matrices/cubes associated with the genetic codes play important roles on a new understanding of genetic code systems and can lead to new effective algorithms of information processing for modeling mutual communication among different parts of the genetic ensemble.[69]\n",

On the other hand, the Golden mean relations also correspond with the essentiality–nonessentiality of protein amino acids, as well as with their splitting into two classes handled by two classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.[69]\n",

He found that the consecutive sets of the DNA nucleotides are organized in frames of remote order called RESONANCES.

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">As is known, Lorentz’s transformations used in special relativity theory (SRT) are the transformations of the coordinates of the events (x, y, z, t) at the transition from one inertial coordinate system (ICS) K to another ICS K ′ , which is moving relatively to ICS K with a constant velocity V.\n",
    "The transformations were named in honor of Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853- 1928), who introduced them in order to eliminate the contradictions between Maxwell’s electrodynamics and Newton's mechanics. Lorentz’s transformations were first published in 1904, but at that time their form was not perfect. The French mathematician Jules Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) brought them to modern form.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In 1908, that is, three years after the promulgation of SRT, the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909) gave the original geometrical interpretation of Lorentz’s transformations. In Minkowski’s space, a geometrical link between two ICS K and K′ are established with the help of hyperbolic rotation, a motion similar to a normal turn of the Cartesian system in Euclidean space. However, the coordinates of x′ and t′ in the ICS K′ are connected with the coordinates of x and t of the ICS K by using classical hyperbolic functions. Thus, Lorentz’stransformations in Minkowski’s geometry are nothing as the relations of hyperbolic trigonometry expressed in physics terms. This means that Minkowski’s geometry is hyperbolic interpretation of SRT and therefore it is a revolutionary breakthrough in geometric representations of physics, a way out on a qualitatively new level of relations between physics and geometry.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Alexey Stakhov and Samuil Aranson put forward in [38] the following hypotheses concerning the “golden” SRT :\n",
    "1.The first hypothesis concerns the light velocity in vacuum. As is well known, the main dispute concerning the SRT, basically, is about the principle of the constancy of the light velocity in vacuum. In recent years a lot of scientists in the field of cosmology put forward a hypothesis, which puts doubt the permanence of the light velocity in vacuum - a fundamental physical constant, on which the basic laws of modern physics are based. Thus, the first hypothesis is that the light velocity in vacuum was changed in process of the Universe evolution .\n",
    "2. Another fundamental idea involves with the factor of the Universe self-organization in the process of its evolution. According to modern view [70], a few stages of self-organization and degradation can be identified in process of the Universe development: initial vacuum, the emergence of superstrings, the birth of particles, the separation of matter and radiation, the birth of the Sun, stars, and galaxies, the emergence of civilization, the death of Sun, the death of the Universe. The main idea of the article [38] is to unite the fact of the light velocity change during the Universe evolution with the factor of its self- organization, that is, to introduce a dependence of the light velocity in vacuum from some self- organization parameter ψ , which does not have dimension and is changing within: ($−∞ < \\psi < +∞$).\n",
    "The light velocity in vacuum c is depending on the “self-organization” parameter $\\psi$ ($−∞ < \\psi < +∞$) and this dependence has the following form:\n",
    "$$ c = c(\\psi) = \\overline{c}(\\psi)c_0 \\tag{42} $$\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">As follows from (42), the light velocity in vacuum is a product of the two parameters: $c_0$ and $c(\\psi)$ . The parameter $c_0 = const$, having dimension [$m.sec^{-1}$], is called normalizing factor. It is assumed in [38] that the constant parameter $c_0$ is equal to Einstein’s light velocity in vacuum ($2.998 \\times 10^8 m.sec^{-1}$) divided by the golden mean $Φ =(1 + \\sqrt5)/2≈1,61803$. The dimensionless parameter $c(\\psi)$ is called *non-\n",
    "singular normalized Fibonacci velocity of light in vacuum*.\n",
    "3. The “golden” Fibonacci goniometry is used for the introduction of the Fibonacci-Lorentz transformations, which are a generalization of the classical Lorentz transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Based on this approach, Alexey Stakhov and Samuil Aranson have obtained in [38] new cosmological results in the Universe evolution, beginning with the «Big Bang». In particular, they put forward a hypothesis that there are two “bifurcation points” in the Universe evolution. The first one corresponds to the “Big Bang”, and the second one corresponds to the transition of the Universe from the Dark Ages to the Shining Period, where light and first stars have arisen. The speed of light immediately after the second “Bifurcation point” is very high, but as far as the evolution of the Universe the speed of light starts to drop and reaches the limit value C ≈ 300 000 $km.sec^{−1}$ ."

How can all that be going on in that tiny space? Why should it take an infinite amount of logic to figure out what a tiny piece of space–time is going to do? So I have often made the hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end the machinery will be revealed and the laws will turn out to be simple, like the checker board with all its apparent complexities.\", wrote Feynman in 1965. \n",

This turns out to be the quantum origin of all forces. Therefore, forces can be thought of being digital rather than analogue.\n",

Therefore many physicists agree that the current set of fundamental physical laws is incomplete. [72] Because Hz, oscillations per second, is superficially seen only a man-made measure, this seems to be the weakest point of our line of reasoning. Behind the definition of the second is the velocity of light ($c = 299 792 458$ m/s), which is the constant on which size all other physical constants depend upon and hence represents the inherent speed limit that any particle information pattern is able to achieve. In this system of present-day constants the Planck length has the value $1.6160\\times10^35m$ (standard uncertainty $0.0012 \\times 10^{35} m$). If we fix instead the Planck length at the value of the golden mean at $1.6180 \\times 10^35 m$ and recalculate consequently all other physical variables, this means for the numerical size of the second only a trivial correction not relevant for our argument.

What is really remarkable of this Cantorian space–time is that applying all the probabilistic necessary laws, the values of the Hausdorff dimension are intrinsically linked to the golden mean and its successive powers. The correlated fluctuations of the fractal space–time are analogous to the Bose–Einstein condensation phenomenon. The polynomial roots of higher order Fibonaccis, scaling a quasi- periodic hierarchy, are based on golden mean powers.\n",

If we understand span as the quantum number $n$ of a harmonic oscillator, we obtain this result from the EEG. The metric of brain waves can always be understood as a superposition of $n$ harmonics times 2Ф, where half of the fundamental is the golden mean $Ф = 1.618$ as the point of resonance. Such wave packets scaled in powers of the golden mean have to be understood as numbers with directions, where bifurcations occur at the edge of chaos, i.e. $2Ф = 3 + Ф^3$. they discuss also similarities with El Naschie's theory for high energy particle's physics.\n",

    "There can be no doubt that our brain uses for computing inherent and inborn properties of the physical universe.[72] We have or learn into the neural network of our brains the relationships between external stimuli, the integer powers of the golden mean, the Fibonacci word and Lucas numbers, and we are probably able to use the relationships between the Beatty sequences of $e$ , $\\pi$ and $Ф$, and we use hundreds of similar relationships (many of them may still be undiscovered by contemporary mathematics) between numbers for encoding and decoding information simultaneously and unconsciously by wavelets. A genius like Ramanujan gave us some closed fraction formulae which contain $e$ , $\\pi$ and $Ф$ all together in a single equation. Together with Euler's famous formula $e^{i\\pi} = 0$ for the unit circle we all understand in our subconsciousness these irrational numbers as rules for superposition and time reversal by folding, symmetry breaking and compactification. By raising $Ф = 1+ф$ to the third power, we get the Hausdorff dimension of Cantorian space–time of El Naschie [77]   $(1+ф)^3 =  2 + \\sqrt5 = 4 + ф^3 = (1+ф)/(1-ф) = \\frac{1}{ф^3} = 4.236 $, which plays also a profound role in knot theory, von Neumann's algebra, quasi-crystals and non-commutative geometry.

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">If we, for example, look into Wolfram's \"A New Kind of Science\" we see that some models are full of Pascal triangles. Behind such a triangle are always the Fibonaccis and hence the golden mean. That means that by encoding and decoding the information of such and any automaton or system no other wave could be more optimal than a wavelet containing the golden mean itself. The quantization of time simply represents the number of regular clock cycles elapsed between two events and all changes that occur must occur as localised changes. At the lowest level our brain seems to be utterly simple, deterministic and mathematical in nature. Despite this, we can never read out the numeric state of any brain in a foreseeable future. We can only infer this type of information by observing larger scale patterns as it is the phenomenon of memory span.\n",

In order to understand our brain, there is no other way than to come to a deeper understanding of the world around us. "

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">While Einstein’s relativity-theory has shown us that, in the large, spacetime geometry is curved and quite different from our passive, flat and smooth classical space and time, modern results in high energy physics are forcing us to reconsider the properties not only of flatness but also of the smoothness of the geometry of spacetime at the quantum scale [70,80] This is exactly what El Naschie propose in his paper - a substantially novel approach to quantum gravity and particle physics based on the idea that spacetime is basically a large infinite-dimensional but hierarchical, disconnected and thus non-differentiable Cantor Set [81,82].\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The classical spacetime symmetry in which our experiments are inevitably conducted and the internal Gauge symmetry required by particle physics leads to what is known in quantum field theory as anomalies [83,84]. It turns out that there are two strategies to completely eliminate these anomalies. A well-known example for this type of theory is Connes’ non-commutative geometry which is a natural extension of von Neumann’s continuous geometry [85,86]. In fact, von Neumann used to joke about his own proposal by calling it point-less geometry.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The first possibility is to formulate our geometry and topology without any direct reference to the concept of points.\n",
    "* The second possibility is to avoid having any points at all in the theory. This possibility was made use of in String theory and one of the main reasons for the phenomenal success and popularity of String-Theory lies in this fact [87].\n",
    "  \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">El Naschie studied a theory using geometry with points which upon close examination reveal them- selves not as a point but as a cluster of points. Every point in this cluster, when re-examined, reveals itself again as another cluster of points and so on ad infinitum. Not surprisingly this type of geometry is well-known since a long time to mathematicians and seems to have been discovered first by the German mathematician Georg Cantor, the inventor of Set-Theory [88,89]. The famous Triadic Cantor Set is probably the simplest and definitely the best known example of such geometry (Execute the cell below and see Fig. 1). Cantor sets are at the heart of modern mathematics and a particular form of non-metric spaces and geometry, known in modern parlance as fractals.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">From the basic assumption that spacetime is essentially a very large Cantor Set El Naschie extract a simple theory and a great deal of information about particle physics, gravity and the combination of the two, namely quantum gravity [90].\n",
    "They recall that gravity is a property of spacetime in the large. By contrast, particle physics is a property of space- time at the very small, or more accurately on the quantum level of observation. This disparity in size which corre- sponds to disparity in the energy scale is one, if not the main reasons behind the unyielding resistance against all attempts to reconcile the two fundamental theories. However, in Cantorian fractal spacetime where unlike the smooth classical case there is no a-priori given natural scale it is very easy to make the very large meet the very smal.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">The Hausdorff dimension will be denoted by $ d^{(0)} $. The exact numerical value of this Hausdorff dimension which must be less than unity is left open and will be fixed as a result of our construction and not put in by hand. Let us add infinitely many such Cantor sets together. The first set Hausdorff dimension is $ d^{(0)} $, the second will be $ (d^{(0)})^2 $, the third will be $ (d^{(0)})^3 $, and so on. For the power infinity the corresponding Hausdorff dimension will be zero summing $ (d_c^{(0)})^n $ from zero to infinity gives us  $ 1/(1-d^{(0)}) $. To be able to say how many dimensions there are in terms of the dimension of the original set we must divide the sum by $ d^{(0)} $). Thus the final expression can be shown to be effectively a weighted Hausdorff dimension of the entire new set which is formally made of infinitely many dimensions, but each dimension has a different weight. Consequently although we have infinitely many dimensions we can still sum them all and the sum will converge to a finite value given by $ 1/d^{(0)}(1-d^{(0)}) $ [91].\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> In other words, we have added infinitely many topological dimensions $n$ from zero to infinity, but each dimension has a weight equal to $(d^{(0)})^n$. Consequently the sum of all dimensions is equal to the sum from 0 to infinity of $ (n)(d^{(0)})^n $. This series is easily summed up exactly and is equal $ (1 + d^{(0)})/(1 - d^{(0)}) $.\n",
    "This expression may be regarded as the average topological dimensions where our infinite-dimensional but hierarchal Cantor set lives. Cantorian manifold is supposed to\n",

    "that we find an equation to determine $ d^{(0)} $ from the condition that the dimensionality of the embedding space and the dimensionality of the manifold to be embedded in it should be equal. The mathematical terminology for that is ‘‘space filling” condition [91–93]. Proceeding in this way the resulting equation $ (d^{(0)})^2 +  d^{(0)} - 1 =0 $ is a simple quadratic equation with the  only positive root $ (d_c^{(0)}) = (\\sqrt5-1)/2 = 0.618033989 $, namely the Golden Mean [94].\n",

The reader should give attention to how the Menger–Uhryson and the Hausdorff dimension are linked in a single equation $d^{(n)}=(1/d_c^{(0)})^{n-1}$ . For $n = 0$ we find $d_c^{(0)}=\\phi$ as should be. For $n = 1$ we find our so called normality condition $d_c^{(1)}=1$. However only for $n = D = 4$ we find our Hausdorff dimension $d(4)=(1/\\phi)^{4-1}=(4/\\phi)^3=4+\\phi^3$ . That is why we say the Menger–Uhrysohn topological dimension is exactly 4.\n",

Said differently: that is why in this manifold there is no clash between internal dimensions and classical dimensions. Looked at it from very far it looks like a four dimen- sional manifold exactly as the spacetime of relativity. On closer examination, however, it is a four dimensional manifold surrounding another four dimensional manifold which is again enclosing a further four dimensional manifold and so on ad infinitum. \n",

In addition to this result, we just found that the Menger–Uhrysohn dimension, corresponding to $4 + (\\phi)^3 $ is exactly 4. This is the result we promised the reader to prove earlier on. Indeed, we have shown that we have a remarkable, non-differentiable manifold which we could call now Cantorian spacetime manifold which is fixed by three dimensions as we said earlier. It is formally infinite-dimensional, but seen from very far, it mimics our smooth four dimensional spacetime manifold, in addition to hav- ing a Hausdorff dimension equal $4 + (\\phi)^3$. This we interpreted earlier on as a self-similar universe with four dimensions inside four dimensions, inside four dimensions and so on like a Russian doll [91].\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">We claim that the preceding analysis constitutes the first mathematical derivation of the exact dimensions of spacetime starting from basic principles. In this derivation our Golden Mean Hausdorff dimension Cantor Set played the role of the ele- mentary particle of spacetime, that is to say the building blocks of the medium which we frequently refer to wrongly as empty nothingness or esoteric, although we should know better at least since the advent of Einstein relativity which pro- duces force and thus energy and matter from the curvature of spacetime, i.e. nothingness [95].\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The manifold corresponding to the Cantorian spacetime that we are proposing is strictly speaking non-differentiable and thus not a manifold. By definition a manifold is differentiable, however a Cantor Set is not continuous and therefore, strictly speaking, not a manifold. Nevertheless there are many important non-differentiable structures nowadays which we still re- gard as quasi-manifold and for the sake of simplicity we are dropping the word quasi. In fact, this property of not being con- tinuous, is more than welcome in particle physics which obeys the Planck quantum. In such a case we do not have the schism between a discrete matter and energy field and a continuous spacetime which it inhabits. On the other hand general rela- tivity requires a smooth and differentiable spacetime manifold linking gravity with the geometry of spacetime. In fact this is again the wonderful thing about our manifold. Looking at this manifold from afar, that is to say reducing the accuracy of observation which in turn is equivalent to reducing the energy scale, our manifold appears smooth and differentiable. In other words we have an observation dependent topology [91].By putting parts of this smooth manifold under a magnifying glass, its real non-differentiable nature becomes apparent again. Not only that, but even the dimensionality of our manifold is also observation dependent, that is to say energy scale dependent.  Looking at our manifold from very far, it appears four dimensional; but taking it under a magnifying glass the dimensionality may increase to 10, 26, 137, or even infinitely many dimensions if our magnifying glass is infinitely strong. \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Cantor Set is the simplest transfinite set that there is. Let us construct a  Cantor Set (See Fig. 2a). Consider the unit interval. Remove the middle third of this interval, except for the end points. We are now left with two intervals of the length one third. Remove the middle one third of each of the two left intervals except again for the end points. Repeating this process infinitely many times we are left with a remarkable completely disjointed points set. This point set has no length, because we have removed the entire interval. Mathematicians refer to that as a point set of measure zero. In some sense there is nothing left anymore. Miraculously, however, this alleged nothingness has a respectable and rel- atively sizable dimension. Such point set dimension is called a Hausdorff dimension, which in this case is equal to the natural logarithm of the number of the parts left in each iteration divided by the number of divisions in each iteration. In our case this is $ln2$ divided by $ln3$.\n",

    "## 7.Conclusion\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">With this referative review I can conclude that there is enough evidence that whenever the Golden ratio phi is involved, beauty, selforganization and  harmony are evident, in many aspects of science, life and the Universe itself. It is more a beggining for me than an end. All these researches and articles available for the connection of phi and the surrounding macro and micro world is curious and fascinating.  When thinking how many obects in macro and micro cosmos are phenomenon with phi hidden in their propotions. Also the so-called \"third eye\" - the epuphises has structure corresponding to phi. Is it just a coincidence or not? If the  principle of information coding by the brain seems to be based on the golden mean is it possible the principle of information coding in universe to be based on it ... as one of the Hermes Trismegists' principles \"What above so below\"?"

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">By studying sources of mathematics origins, we inevitably come to Pythagoras and his doctrine, called Pythagoreanism [1]. According to the tradition, Pythagoreans were divided into two separate schools of thought, the mathēmatikoi (mathematicians) and the akousmatikoi (listeners). Listeners developed religious and ritual aspects of Pythagoreanism, mathematicians studied four Pythagorean MATHEM’s: arithmetic, geometry, harmonics and spherics. These MATHEM’s, according to Pythagoras, were the main component parts of mathematics. Unfortunately, the Pythagorean MATHEM of harmonics was lost in mathematics in the process of historical development.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Johannes Kepler, brilliant astronomer and author of \"Kepler's laws,” expressed his admiration for the golden ratio in the following words:\n",
    "\"Geometry has two great treasures: one is the theorem of Pythagoras; the other the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first we may compare to a measure of gold; the second we may name a precious jewel.\" (taken from [2]). You should recall that the ancient problem of the division of a line segment in extreme and mean ratio was Euclid’s language for the golden ratio! Thus, the idea of Harmony, which underlies the ancient Greek doctrine of Nature, was the main “paradigm” of Greek science starting from Pythagoras and ending by Euclid. This relates directly to the golden ratio and Platonic solids, which are the most important Greek mathematical discoveries, which had expressed Universe Harmony.[3]\n",
    " \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Dirac states: “If this theory is really beautiful, then it necessarily will appear as a fine model of important physical phenomena. It is necessary to search for these phenomena to develop applications of the beautiful mathematical theory and to interpret them as predictions of new laws of physics.” Thus, according to Dirac, all new physics, including relativistic and quantum, develop in this way.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In 1962, American physicist and historian of science Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996) published the book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". In his book, Kuhn had substantiated a concept of changing \"scientific paradigms\" as premise of the “scientific revolutions.” What was the major idea (paradigm) of the ancient Greek science? A majority of researchers give the following answer: the idea of Harmony associated with the \"golden ratio\" and “Platonic Solids\". The prominent Russian philosopher Alexey Losiv argues: “From Plato’s point of view, and in general in terms of the entire ancient cosmology, the Universe is determined as a certain proportional whole that obeys the law of harmonic division - the golden section. *The ancient Greek system of cosmic proportions in the literature is then interpreted as a curious result of unrestrained and wild imagination. In such explanations we can see the unscientific helplessness of those who claim it. However, we can understand this historical and aesthetic phenomenon only in connection with a holistic understanding of history, that is, by using a dialectical view of culture and looking for the answer in the peculiarities of ancient social life.\"*[3] \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Alexey Stakhov’s book “The Mathematics of Harmony. From Euclid to Contemporary Mathematics and Computer Science” (World Scientific, 2009) [2] and Stakhov & Aranson’s book “Golden” Non- Euclidean Geometry. Hilbert’s Fourth Problem, “Golden” Dynamical System, and Fine-Structure Constant” (World Scientific, 2016) [4] can be seen as the first attempts to revive in modern science and mathematics, the Pythagorean MATEM of \"harmonics\" and also the \"harmonic ideas” of Pythagoras, Plato and Euclid. It is shown in the books [2,6,7,23,26,27,33,34,51,57,58] and the articles [8 - 22,25,28- 32, 35-50,52-56] that the \"harmonic ideas” of Pythagoras, Plato and Euclid affect not only the foundations of modern theoretical physics (in particular, Einstein’s special theory of relativity) and the foundations of mathematics (in particular, number theory and geometry), but they can also be source of the numeral systems with irrational bases, which are the basis of new computer projects (Fibonacci computers). Modern Mathematics of Harmony contains a large number of excellent mathematical results, which can decorate many of the traditional mathematical disciplines. We are talking about new look on the history of mathematics (Proclus’ hypothesis), about new classes of recurrent relations and new mathematical constants, following from Pascal’s triangle, about new types of recursive hyperbolic functions, about the original solution of Hilbert’s Fourth Problem, which underlies the \"Golden\" non- Euclidean geometry, about new numeral systems with irrational bases for computer science. In addition, the Mathematics of Harmony develops new original view on special theory of relativity, which leads us to a new view on the fundamental physical constants such as the Fine-Structure Constant.[3]\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">The question arises, what purpose pursued Euclid by placing Platonic solids in the final book of his Elements.[3] Proclus’ hypothesis, formulated in the 5th century by the Greek philosopher and mathematician Proclus Diadochus (412 – 485), contains a surprising answer to this question [29]. According to Proclus, Euclid’s main goal at writing his Elements was not simply to set forth geometry itself what is traditional view on Euclid’s Elements, but to build a complete theory of the regular polyhedra (“Platonic solids”) what was an essential element (paradigm) of Plato's cosmology. This theory was outlined by Euclid in the concluding or thirteenth book of the Elements. This fact in itself is an indirect confirmation of Proclus’ hypothesis. Often the most important scientific information is found in the concluding part of scientific publication. Proclus' hypothesis is the most unexpected hypothesis in the history of mathematics, which alters our traditional ideas about the history of mathematics. It follows from this hypothesis that Euclid’s Elements are the source of the two directions in the history of mathematics - Classical Mathematics and Mathematics of Harmony.[3]\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">For many centuries, the creation of Classic Mathematics, Queen of the Natural Sciences, was the main goal of mathematicians. However, by studying the works of Pythagoras, Plato, Euclid, Fibonacci, Pacioli, and Kepler, we can conclude that the intellectual forces of many prominent mathematicians and thinkers were directed towards the development of the basic concepts and applications of the Mathematics of Harmony what, according to Proclus, was the main “paradigm” of Euclid’s Elements. Unfortunately, these two important mathematical approaches (Classic Mathematics and the Mathematics of Harmony) evolved separately from one another.  e time has come to unite these two mathematical approaches.  This important unification can now lead to novel scientific discoveries in both mathematics and the theoretical natural sciences.[3]\n",

The geometry of both relate directly to the golden ratio. Indeed, all faces of the dodecahedron are regular pentagons, based on the golden ratio. If we look closely at the icosahedron in Fig. 1e, we can see that in each of its vertices the five triangles come together and their outer edges form a regular pentagon. These facts reveal the crucial role the golden ratio in the geometric construction of these two Platonic solids.[3]\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><div style=\"text-indent: 30px\">However, there are other deep mathematical confirmations of the fundamental role of the golden ratio in the icosahedron and dodecahedron.[3] The Platonic solids have three specific spheres. The first (inner) sphere is inscribed inside the Platonic solid and touches the centers of its faces. Let denote the radius of the inner sphere as $R_i$. The second or middle sphere of the Platonic solid touches its ribs. We denote the radius of the middle sphere as $R_m$. Finally, the third (outer) sphere is circumscribed around the Platonic solid and passes through its vertices. We denote its radius as $R_c$ . In geometry, it is demonstrated that the values of the radii of these spheres for the dodecahedron and the icosahedron with an edge of unit length is expressed through the golden ratio (Table 1).\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Soroko's main idea was to study real systems from the dialectical point of view. As is well known, any natural object can be represented as the dialectical unity of the two opposite sides A and B.[59] This dialectical connection may be expressed in the following form:\n",
    "$$ A+B=U (Universum) \\tag{32}$$\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The equality (32) is the most general expression of the so-called conservation law. Here A and B are distinctions inside of the Unity, logically disjoint classes of the whole. There is the one requirement that A and B need to be measured by the same measure. Probability and inprobability of events, mass and energy, the nucleus of an atom and its envelope, substance and field, anode and cathode, animals and plants, spiritual and material beginnings in a value system, and profit and cost are various examples of (32).\n",
    "The identity (32) may be reduced to the following normalized form:\n",
    "$$ \\overline{A}+\\overline{B}=1, \\tag{33}$$ \n",

    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Let us consider the process of system self-organization. This one is reduced to the passage of the system into some \"harmonic\" state called the state of “harmonic” equilibrium. There is some correlation or proportion between the sides A and B of the dialectical contradiction (30) for the state of thermodynamic equilibrium. This correlation has a strictly regular character and is the cause of system stability. Soroko uses the principle of multiple relations to find a connecting law between A and B in the state of “harmonic” equilibrium. This principle is well known in chemistry as Dalton's Law and in crystallography as the law of rational parameters.\n",
    "By studying the equality (33), Soroko came to conclusion that the generalized principle of the golden section (27) can be used for the solution to this important problem and has finished his very interesting reasoning’s by the following assertion called \"Law of structural harmony of systems\":\n",

    "$$N = a_na_{n-1}...a_i...a_1 \\tag{35}$$ \n",
    "Note that the notion of the Fibonacci $p$-code (34) includes an infinite number of different positional “binary” representations of natural numbers because every p produces its own Fibonacci $p$-code ($p=0,1,2,3,...$). In particular, for the case $p=0$ the Fibonacci p-code (34) is reduced to the classical binary code:\n",
    "$$ N=a_n2^{n-1}+a_{n-1}2^{n-2}+...+a_i^{2i-1}+...+a_12^0 \\tag{36}$$ For the case $p=1$ the Fibonacci $p$-code (34) is reduced to the following sum:\n",

    "Note that Fibonacci’s representation (37) in the “Fibonacci numbers theory” [61] is called Zekendorf’s sum after Belgian researcher Eduardo Zekendorf (1901-1983).

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The introduced above new positional representations – Fibonacci $p$-code (34), Bergman system (24) and codes of the golden $p$-proportions can be the sources of new computer projects – Fibonacci computers. This concept, first described in Stakhov’s book [62], is one of the important ideas of modern computer science. The essence of the concept consists of the following. Modern computers are based on the binary system (21), which represents all numbers as the sums of the binary numbers with binary coefficients, 0 and 1. However, the binary system (21) is non-redundant what does not allow detecting errors, which could appear in computer in the process of its exploitation. In order to eliminate this shortcoming, Alexey Stakhov suggested in [62] to use the Fibonacci $p$-codes and codes of the golden $p$-proportions.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">It is important to note the recent applications of the Fibonacci codes (34) to digital signal processing. In the Russian science the idea of the use of Fibonacci $p$-numbers for the design of superfast algorithms for digital signal processing were actively developed by the Professor Vladimir Chernov, Doctor in Physics and Mathematics at Samara the Images Processing Institute of the Russian Academy of Science [62]. Also Fibonacci $p$-numbers for the development of superfast algorithms for digital signal processing are widely used by the research group from the Tampere International Center for Signal Processing (Finland). As is shown in the book [58], the superfast algorithms for digital signal processing requires a processing of numerical data represented in the Fibonacci p-codes (34). This means that for the realization of such superfast transformations require the specialized Fibonacci signal processors! This is why the problem of Fibonacci processor development is of vital concern today!\n",

    "(2) the main practical peculiarity of the Fibonacci encoding/decoding method in Table. 3 is the fact that large information units, in particular, matrix elements, are objects of detection and correction of errors;\n",

Considering the number of hydrogen bonds of genetic code matrix and establishing a relation with golden ratio matrix, Hu et al. has constructed three-dimensional cubes from two-dimensional matrices. Furthermore, they revealed some numerical patterns of golden ratios under basic addition operation. The relationship data about the genetic stochastic matrices/cubes associated with the genetic codes play important roles on a new understanding of genetic code systems and can lead to new effective algorithms of information processing for modeling mutual communication among different parts of the genetic ensemble.[69]\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">As is known, Lorentz’s transformations used in special relativity theory (SRT) are the transformations of the coordinates of the events (x, y, z, t) at the transition from one inertial coordinate system (ICS) K to another ICS K ′ , which is moving relatively to ICS K with a constant velocity V.\n",
    "The transformations were named in honor of Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853- 1928), who introduced them in order to eliminate the contradictions between Maxwell’s electrodynamics and Newton's mechanics. Lorentz’s transformations were first published in 1904, but at that time their form was not perfect. The French mathematician Jules Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) brought them to modern form.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In 1908, that is, three years after the promulgation of SRT, the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909) gave the original geometrical interpretation of Lorentz’s transformations. In Minkowski’s space, a geometrical link between two ICS K and K′ are established with the help of hyperbolic rotation, a motion similar to a normal turn of the Cartesian system in Euclidean space. However, the coordinates of x′ and t′ in the ICS K′ are connected with the coordinates of x and t of the ICS K by using classical hyperbolic functions. Thus, Lorentz’stransformations in Minkowski’s geometry are nothing as the relations of hyperbolic trigonometry expressed in physics terms. This means that Minkowski’s geometry is hyperbolic interpretation of SRT and therefore it is a revolutionary breakthrough in geometric representations of physics, a way out on a qualitatively new level of relations between physics and geometry.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Alexey Stakhov and Samuil Aranson put forward in [38] the following hypotheses concerning the “golden” SRT :\n",
    "1.The first hypothesis concerns the light velocity in vacuum. As is well known, the main dispute concerning the SRT, basically, is about the principle of the constancy of the light velocity in vacuum. In recent years a lot of scientists in the field of cosmology put forward a hypothesis, which puts doubt the permanence of the light velocity in vacuum - a fundamental physical constant, on which the basic laws of modern physics are based. Thus, the first hypothesis is that the light velocity in vacuum was changed in process of the Universe evolution .\n",
    "2. Another fundamental idea involves with the factor of the Universe self-organization in the process of its evolution. According to modern view [70], a few stages of self-organization and degradation can be identified in process of the Universe development: initial vacuum, the emergence of superstrings, the birth of particles, the separation of matter and radiation, the birth of the Sun, stars, and galaxies, the emergence of civilization, the death of Sun, the death of the Universe. The main idea of the article [38] is to unite the fact of the light velocity change during the Universe evolution with the factor of its self- organization, that is, to introduce a dependence of the light velocity in vacuum from some self- organization parameter ψ , which does not have dimension and is changing within: ($−∞ < \\psi < +∞$).\n",
    "The light velocity in vacuum c is depending on the “self-organization” parameter $\\psi$ ($−∞ < \\psi < +∞$) and this dependence has the following form:\n",
    "$$ c = c(\\psi) = \\overline{c}(\\psi)c_0 \\tag{42} $$\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">As follows from (42), the light velocity in vacuum is a product of the two parameters: $c_0$ and $c(\\psi)$ . The parameter $c_0 = const$, having dimension [$m.sec^{-1}$], is called normalizing factor. It is assumed in [38] that the constant parameter $c_0$ is equal to Einstein’s light velocity in vacuum ($2.998 \\times 10^8 m.sec^{-1}$) divided by the golden mean $Φ =(1 + \\sqrt5)/2≈1,61803$. The dimensionless parameter $c(\\psi)$ is called *non-\n",
    "singular normalized Fibonacci velocity of light in vacuum*.\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Based on this approach, Alexey Stakhov and Samuil Aranson have obtained in [38] new cosmological results in the Universe evolution, beginning with the «Big Bang». In particular, they put forward a hypothesis that there are two “bifurcation points” in the Universe evolution. The first one corresponds to the “Big Bang”, and the second one corresponds to the transition of the Universe from the Dark Ages to the Shining Period, where light and first stars have arisen. The speed of light immediately after the second “Bifurcation point” is very high, but as far as the evolution of the Universe the speed of light starts to drop and reaches the limit value C ≈ 300 000 $km.sec^{−1}$ .\n",

How can all that be going on in that tiny space? Why should it take an infinite amount of logic to figure out what a tiny piece of space–time is going to do? So I have often made the hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end the machinery will be revealed and the laws will turn out to be simple, like the checker board with all its apparent complexities.\", wrote Feynman in 1965. \n",

The absorption of a vector boson information pattern changes the internal oscillation state of a particle, and causes an impulse of motion to occur along a particular direction. This turns out to be the quantum origin of all forces. Therefore, forces can be thought of being digital rather than analogue.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Quantum mechanics seems to require the quantization of all physical quantities on the small scale, yet space and time are still treated in most cases as a classical space–time continuum, where there are an infinite number of space points between any two given locations, no matter how close. Therefore many physicists agree that the current set of fundamental physical laws is incomplete. [72] Because Hz, oscillations per second, is superficially seen only a man-made measure, this seems to be the weakest point of our line of reasoning. Behind the definition of the second is the velocity of light ($c = 299 792 458$ m/s), which is the constant on which size all other physical constants depend upon and hence represents the inherent speed limit that any particle information pattern is able to achieve. In this system of present-day constants the Planck length has the value $1.6160\\times10^35m$ (standard uncertainty $0.0012 \\times 10^{35} m$). If we fix instead the Planck length at the value of the golden mean at $1.6180 \\times 10^35 m$ and recalculate consequently all other physical variables, this means for the numerical size of the second only a trivial correction not relevant for our argument.

Bianconi and Barab [73] discovered that not only neural networks but all evolving networks, including the World Wide Web and business networks, can be mapped into an equilibrium Bose gas, where nodes correspond to energy levels and links represent particles. Still unaware of the research by Pascual-Leone, for these network researchers this correspondence between network dynamics and a Bose gas was highly unexpected. [74]\n",

What is really remarkable of this Cantorian space–time is that applying all the probabilistic necessary laws, the values of the Hausdorff dimension are intrinsically linked to the golden mean and its successive powers. The correlated fluctuations of the fractal space–time are analogous to the Bose–Einstein condensation phenomenon. The polynomial roots of higher order Fibonaccis, scaling a quasi- periodic hierarchy, are based on golden mean powers.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> The principle of information coding by the brain seems to be based on the golden mean.[72] For decades psychologists have claimed memory span to be the missing link between psychometric intelligence and cognition.  If we understand span as the quantum number $n$ of a harmonic oscillator, we obtain this result from the EEG. The metric of brain waves can always be understood as a superposition of $n$ harmonics times 2Ф, where half of the fundamental is the golden mean $Ф = 1.618$ as the point of resonance. Such wave packets scaled in powers of the golden mean have to be understood as numbers with directions, where bifurcations occur at the edge of chaos, i.e. $2Ф = 3 + Ф^3$. they discuss also similarities with El Naschie's theory for high energy particle's physics.\n",

    "There can be no doubt that our brain uses for computing inherent and inborn properties of the physical universe.[72] We have or learn into the neural network of our brains the relationships between external stimuli, the integer powers of the golden mean, the Fibonacci word and Lucas numbers, and we are probably able to use the relationships between the Beatty sequences of $e$ , $\\pi$ and $Ф$, and we use hundreds of similar relationships (many of them may still be undiscovered by contemporary mathematics) between numbers for encoding and decoding information simultaneously and unconsciously by wavelets. A genius like Ramanujan gave us some closed fraction formulae which contain $e$ , $\\pi$ and $Ф$ all together in a single equation. Together with Euler's famous formula $e^{i\\pi} = 0$ for the unit circle we all understand in our subconsciousness these irrational numbers as rules for superposition and time reversal by folding, symmetry breaking and compactification. By raising $Ф = 1+ф$ to the third power, we get the Hausdorff dimension of Cantorian space–time of El Naschie [77]   $(1+ф)^3 =  2 + \\sqrt5 = 4 + ф^3 = (1+ф)/(1-ф) = \\frac{1}{ф^3} = 4.236 $, which plays also a profound role in knot theory, von Neumann's algebra, quasi-crystals and non-commutative geometry.

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Indeed, there is a growing minority of scholars who understand the world as something like a cellular automaton running with and counting numbers. The numerical state of all the cells, everywhere, changes at a regular synchronised interval called a clock cycle.

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">If we, for example, look into Wolfram's \"A New Kind of Science\" we see that some models are full of Pascal triangles. Behind such a triangle are always the Fibonaccis and hence the golden mean. That means that by encoding and decoding the information of such and any automaton or system no other wave could be more optimal than a wavelet containing the golden mean itself. The quantization of time simply represents the number of regular clock cycles elapsed between two events and all changes that occur must occur as localised changes. At the lowest level our brain seems to be utterly simple, deterministic and mathematical in nature. Despite this, we can never read out the numeric state of any brain in a foreseeable future. We can only infer this type of information by observing larger scale patterns as it is the phenomenon of memory span.\n",

In order to understand our brain, there is no other way than to come to a deeper understanding of the world around us. \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">While Einstein’s relativity-theory has shown us that, in the large, spacetime geometry is curved and quite different from our passive, flat and smooth classical space and time, modern results in high energy physics are forcing us to reconsider the properties not only of flatness but also of the smoothness of the geometry of spacetime at the quantum scale [70,80] This is exactly what El Naschie propose in his paper - a substantially novel approach to quantum gravity and particle physics based on the idea that spacetime is basically a large infinite-dimensional but hierarchical, disconnected and thus non-differentiable Cantor Set [81,82].\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The classical spacetime symmetry in which our experiments are inevitably conducted and the internal Gauge symmetry required by particle physics leads to what is known in quantum field theory as anomalies [83,84]. It turns out that there are two strategies to completely eliminate these anomalies. A well-known example for this type of theory is Connes’ non-commutative geometry which is a natural extension of von Neumann’s continuous geometry [85,86]. In fact, von Neumann used to joke about his own proposal by calling it point-less geometry.\n",

    "* The first possibility is to formulate our geometry and topology without any direct reference to the concept of points.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">El Naschie studied a theory using geometry with points which upon close examination reveal them- selves not as a point but as a cluster of points. Every point in this cluster, when re-examined, reveals itself again as another cluster of points and so on ad infinitum. Not surprisingly this type of geometry is well-known since a long time to mathematicians and seems to have been discovered first by the German mathematician Georg Cantor, the inventor of Set-Theory [88,89]. The famous Triadic Cantor Set is probably the simplest and definitely the best known example of such geometry (Execute the cell below and see Fig. 1). Cantor sets are at the heart of modern mathematics and a particular form of non-metric spaces and geometry, known in modern parlance as fractals.\n",

    "They recall that gravity is a property of spacetime in the large. By contrast, particle physics is a property of space- time at the very small, or more accurately on the quantum level of observation. This disparity in size which corre- sponds to disparity in the energy scale is one, if not the main reasons behind the unyielding resistance against all attempts to reconcile the two fundamental theories. However, in Cantorian fractal spacetime where unlike the smooth classical case there is no a-priori given natural scale it is very easy to make the very large meet the very smal.\n",

For the power infinity the corresponding Hausdorff dimension will be zero summing $ (d_c^{(0)})^n $ from zero to infinity gives us  $ 1/(1-d^{(0)}) $. To be able to say how many dimensions there are in terms of the dimension of the original set we must divide the sum by $ d^{(0)} $). Thus the final expression can be shown to be effectively a weighted Hausdorff dimension of the entire new set which is formally made of infinitely many dimensions, but each dimension has a different weight. Consequently although we have infinitely many dimensions we can still sum them all and the sum will converge to a finite value given by $ 1/d^{(0)}(1-d^{(0)}) $ [91].\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> In other words, we have added infinitely many topological dimensions $n$ from zero to infinity, but each dimension has a weight equal to $(d^{(0)})^n$. Consequently the sum of all dimensions is equal to the sum from 0 to infinity of $ (n)(d^{(0)})^n $. This series is easily summed up exactly and is equal $ (1 + d^{(0)})/(1 - d^{(0)}) $.\n",
    "This expression may be regarded as the average topological dimensions where our infinite-dimensional but hierarchal Cantor set lives. Cantorian manifold is supposed to\n",
    "model spacetime and should not have gaps or overlapping points. That can be achieved by equating both expressions. By doing\n",
    "that we find an equation to determine $ d^{(0)} $ from the condition that the dimensionality of the embedding space and the dimensionality of the manifold to be embedded in it should be equal. The mathematical terminology for that is ‘‘space filling” condition [91–93]. Proceeding in this way the resulting equation $ (d^{(0)})^2 +  d^{(0)} - 1 =0 $ is a simple quadratic equation with the  only positive root $ (d_c^{(0)}) = (\\sqrt5-1)/2 = 0.618033989 $, namely the Golden Mean [94].\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Substituting this value back into our average dimensions we find a remarkable number for the average Hausdorff and embedding dimension, namely $4 + \\phi^3  = 4.2360679$. This is the Hausdorff dimension of the core of our Cantorian spacetime manifold as well as being the average topological dimension of the embedding manifold. The reader should give attention to how the Menger–Uhryson and the Hausdorff dimension are linked in a single equation $d^{(n)}=(1/d_c^{(0)})^{n-1}$ . For $n = 0$ we find $d_c^{(0)}=\\phi$ as should be. For $n = 1$ we find our so called normality condition $d_c^{(1)}=1$. However only for $n = D = 4$ we find our Hausdorff dimension $d(4)=(1/\\phi)^{4-1}=(4/\\phi)^3=4+\\phi^3$ . That is why we say the Menger–Uhrysohn topological dimension is exactly 4.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Formally our spacetime manifold is infinite-dimensional, however it has two other finite dimensions, namely an average Hausdorff dimension of $4 + (\\phi)^3 $ and in addition a topological Menger–Uhrysohn dimension which is exactly 4. That is why this manifold can mimic many other dimensionalities depending on the resolution of the observation. Said differently: that is why in this manifold there is no clash between internal dimensions and classical dimensions. Looked at it from very far it looks like a four dimen- sional manifold exactly as the spacetime of relativity. On closer examination, however, it is a four dimensional manifold surrounding another four dimensional manifold which is again enclosing a further four dimensional manifold and so on ad infinitum. \n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Cantor set which we just have seen has a Golden Mean Hausdorff dimension will grow like a drop of ink spreading in a fluid but in this case obeying the Fibonacci law, then we can formulate the following law for our Cantor set. The First term in our series will be the dimension we started with which is the golden mean. The second term will be set equal one. \n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Started with an infinite number of Cantor sets of various dimensions. When mixed and added together we obtained a total average dimension for the so formed manifold equal $4 + (\\phi)^3$. This result was obtained by requiring that the average Hausdorff dimension and the average topological Menger–Uhryson dimension are the same, which turned out to be $4 + (\\phi)^3$. In addition to this result, we just found that the Menger–Uhrysohn dimension, corresponding to $4 + (\\phi)^3 $ is exactly 4. This is the result we promised the reader to prove earlier on. Indeed, we have shown that we have a remarkable, non-differentiable manifold which we could call now Cantorian spacetime manifold which is fixed by three dimensions as we said earlier. It is formally infinite-dimensional, but seen from very far, it mimics our smooth four dimensional spacetime manifold, in addition to hav- ing a Hausdorff dimension equal $4 + (\\phi)^3$. This we interpreted earlier on as a self-similar universe with four dimensions inside four dimensions, inside four dimensions and so on like a Russian doll [91].\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">We claim that the preceding analysis constitutes the first mathematical derivation of the exact dimensions of spacetime starting from basic principles. In this derivation our Golden Mean Hausdorff dimension Cantor Set played the role of the ele- mentary particle of spacetime, that is to say the building blocks of the medium which we frequently refer to wrongly as empty nothingness or esoteric, although we should know better at least since the advent of Einstein relativity which pro- duces force and thus energy and matter from the curvature of spacetime, i.e. nothingness [95].\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The manifold corresponding to the Cantorian spacetime that we are proposing is strictly speaking non-differentiable and thus not a manifold. By definition a manifold is differentiable, however a Cantor Set is not continuous and therefore, strictly speaking, not a manifold. Nevertheless there are many important non-differentiable structures nowadays which we still re- gard as quasi-manifold and for the sake of simplicity we are dropping the word quasi. In fact, this property of not being con- tinuous, is more than welcome in particle physics which obeys the Planck quantum. In such a case we do not have the schism between a discrete matter and energy field and a continuous spacetime which it inhabits. On the other hand general rela- tivity requires a smooth and differentiable spacetime manifold linking gravity with the geometry of spacetime. In fact this is again the wonderful thing about our manifold. Looking at this manifold from afar, that is to say reducing the accuracy of observation which in turn is equivalent to reducing the energy scale, our manifold appears smooth and differentiable. In other words we have an observation dependent topology [91].By putting parts of this smooth manifold under a magnifying glass, its real non-differentiable nature becomes apparent again. Not only that, but even the dimensionality of our manifold is also observation dependent, that is to say energy scale dependent.  Looking at our manifold from very far, it appears four dimensional; but taking it under a magnifying glass the dimensionality may increase to 10, 26, 137, or even infinitely many dimensions if our magnifying glass is infinitely strong. \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Cantor Set is the simplest transfinite set that there is. Let us construct a  Cantor Set (See Fig. 2a). Consider the unit interval. Remove the middle third of this interval, except for the end points. We are now left with two intervals of the length one third. Remove the middle one third of each of the two left intervals except again for the end points. Repeating this process infinitely many times we are left with a remarkable completely disjointed points set. This point set has no length, because we have removed the entire interval. Mathematicians refer to that as a point set of measure zero. In some sense there is nothing left anymore. Miraculously, however, this alleged nothingness has a respectable and rel- atively sizable dimension. Such point set dimension is called a Hausdorff dimension, which in this case is equal to the natural logarithm of the number of the parts left in each iteration divided by the number of divisions in each iteration. In our case this is $ln2$ divided by $ln3$.\n",

    "## 7.Conclusion\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">With this referative review I can conclude that there is enough evidence that whenever the Golden ratio phi is involved, beauty, selforganization and  harmony are evident, in many aspects of science, life and the Universe itself. It is more a beggining for me than an end. All these researches and articles available for the connection of phi and the surrounding macro and micro world is curious and fascinating.  When thinking how many obects in macro and micro cosmos are phenomenon with phi hidden in their propotions. Also the so-called \"third eye\" - the epuphises has structure corresponding to phi. Is it just a coincidence or not? If the  principle of information coding by the brain seems to be based on the golden mean is it possible the principle of information coding in universe to be based on it ... as one of the Hermes Trismegists' principles \"What above so below\"?\n",
